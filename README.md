## Description
This project is a part of my Hybrid mobile application developement -SC4404 class(2/2017) term project.

Room reservation system can be a very helpful system within companies or organizations. It provides services such as reserving a room for a meeting or conference within a few minutes and also can remind the participants about the meeting or conference. Furthermore, it can also reply back to the organizer who will be available or on that day or who will not be able to attend to the meeting.
